## Changes

This fork contains some changes to the original code

- Changed the name of the package to `[signal]` so that the command name and the `[package require]` match.  Use `[package require signal]` rather than `[package require tclsignal]`.
- Bump the version to 1.5.0 to indicate the forked changes.
- Adds the patch level to the version number.
